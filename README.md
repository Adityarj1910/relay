# 🚀 **Relay — A Subscription & Renewal Management System for Students**

*A MERN Stack Full-Stack Application*

Relay is a smart subscription and bill-tracking platform designed primarily for **Teens**, helping them manage recurring expenses like OTT plans, WiFi, gym memberships, and online course subscriptions — with future support for split billing, shared groups, renewal reminders, analytics, and more.

Relay aims to simplify the chaos of monthly/annual renewals by providing a clean dashboard, intelligent alerts, and multi-user management using phone numbers as unique IDs.

## 🌟 **Why Relay?**

We often share subscriptions with roommates and friends, forget renewal dates, lose track of payments, or struggle to remember who owes whom — Relay solves these everyday problems by bringing everything into one platform.
